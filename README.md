See [pico-fi](https://github.com/cfreshman/pico-fi) for more information on the underlying webserver  

### Setup

1. Follow steps & review notes for [pico-fi](https://github.com/cfreshman/pico-fi/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)  
You should see a new `w-pico` wireless network appear (password: `pico1234`). Connect to this network with your computer or smartphone. If the portal doesn't open automatically, try opening an arbitrary website.
1. Once you've connected the Pico W to a network, access the remote repl through the Pico's web address
